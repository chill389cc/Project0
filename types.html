         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="type">Top Roping</td>
            <td>This is fairly simple. You set up a rope at the top of a cliff or mountain and tie into it. The climber ties into one end, it loops through a pulley or look at the top, and is tied at the other end to a belayer who is also on the ground and manages the slack in the rope so that if you fall, you do not fall very far. The belayer can lower you to the ground once you are done. </td>
            <td>Intermediate</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="type">Bouldering</td>
            <td>This requires little to no gear. Technically all you have to do to boulder is find a rock and climb it! You find small climbs that don't take you too high off the ground so that if you fall you don't hurt yourself.</td>
            <td>Novice</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="type">Lead/Sport Climbing</td>
            <td>This is like top roping but instead of the rope being looped through the top of your climb, you start with the rope and your belayer at the bottom and you clip into anchors with the rope as you climb, so if you call you are anchored to the last anchor that you clipped into. This requires special techniques, so it isn't for beginners.</td>
            <td>Advanced</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="type">Trad Climbing</td>
            <td>This is like lead climbing but you have to bring not only your rope but also your anchors with you. Traditionally anchors are bolted into the wall for lead climbing but for trad climbing you bring clips and bolts that you can slip into cracks and slots in the rock so you can anchor yourself while you climb. This is not for the lighthearted.</td>
            <td>Expert</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td class="type">Free Soloing</td>
            <td>This is for the insane. Free soloing is climbing mountains or cliffs without any sort of assist or safety whatsoever. This means if you fall you either die or seriously injure yourself. This style of climbing is not recommended.</td>
            <td>gone bonkers</td>
