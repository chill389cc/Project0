      <h5>Climbing Gear Guide</h5>
      <p>This guide is a simple list to some of the stuff you will need to get started, depending on what type of climbing you will do.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Helmet: This is a basic item for basic protection. No matter what type of climbing you do, we recommend you bring a helmet for everyone that will be particpating, even if they will only be waiting on the ground. </li>
         <li>Rope: You'll need this for most types of climbing. Don't skimp out on a cheap rope, this is literally your lifeline! See <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ropes.html" target="_blank">this</a> guide for how to choose your rope.</li>
         <li>Crash Pad: You'll need one of these four bouldering and maybe even lead or trad climbing. It is a pad you put on the ground so if you take a small fall you can minimize your chance of injury.</li>
         <li>Harness: You'll need one of these in order to type or clip yourself to the rope.</li>
         <li>Belay Device/ATC: You'll need one of these in order to belay someone. Optionally you can also use a GriGri, although those are more expensive and a bit more complicated.</li>
