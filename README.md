This site is titled Climbing Concept and it is a simple site to provide a brief introduction to rock climbing and what you will need to get started. The homepage, index.html, contains a bit of information to lead you to where you want to go on the site. types.html, the Types of Climbing page contains some information to describe some of the types of rock climbing. gear.html, the Gear page, explains some of the equipment you may want to get started in this hobby. location.html, the location page, usually provides some information as to what outdoor and indoor places are good ideas to climb at, but because of the pandemic, it has been abbreviated to just have a warning about not climbing in public places.
Thanks in advance, happy climbing!
